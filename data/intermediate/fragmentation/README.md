## data/intermediate/fragmentation

For my processing of township-level fragstats, I could only process one Hansen scene at a time. These folders and files are broken down according to what Hansen scene they were in (eg 20N_90E was a Hansen image).

These intermediate files are deprecated and are only for reference, if/when this processing is re-conducted for year 2017 as well.
