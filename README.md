# **Temporal and spatial heterogeneity of land cover change in the complex forest landscape of Myanmar**

__Quantification of forest cover and fragmentation between townships in Myanmar, 2001-2017.__

Most folders are currently organized into content related to two categories:
+ forest loss
+ forest fragmentation

The objective is to have this information calculated for all 286 townships of Myanmar, from 2000-2017.

## Current Status

+ forest loss: 
	* calculated from 2000-2016 for all 286 townships
	* calculated from 2000-2017 at the state level

+ forest fragmentation
	* calculated from 2000-2016 for 282 townships


## Abstract

Social and political climate is a primary component of determining land cover change, and turbulent civil conditions can lead to expansive landscape transformations. The country of Myanmar, which in 2009 began a transition from a military regime to a democratizing administration, illustrates how federal reorganization can potentially act as a top-down control of forest cover. We evaluate how rapid development due to political upheaval results in a substantial change in forest cover. We quantified forest loss at the township level and on an annual basis from 2001 to 2017 to determine the heterogeneity of deforestation rates across space and time. Nationwide forest loss sharply increased after the onset of governmental transition, and deforestation rates remained higher than under the previous governmental regime. This drastic increase was driven by high deforestation rates in particular townships, while other townships experience no acceleration, or even decreased rates, of forest loss. Townships differ in resource access and political structure, potentially driving heterogeneous landscape changes. We offer several possible mechanisms as localized agents of forest loss, and highlight intentions to determine social and political drivers, and related implications, of deforestation.
